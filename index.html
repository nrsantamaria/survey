      You selected mostly a's. You should probably learn C#. C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. <strong>Best of luck!</strong></p>
      <p class="programs" id="php">You selected mostly b's. The best language for you is most likely PHP. PHP is most used in content-heavy websites with relatively little user interaction. The most popular content management systems - Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla - are all written in PHP, and everything from local restaurants' websites up through large complex government deployments are built with these tools. If you're keen to work for an agency that builds websites for clients, or if you like the idea of building out sites for brands, businesses, and organizations, PHP is a great direction to go. <strong>So now get out there and code!</strong></p>
      <p class="programs" id="ruby">You selected mostly c's. The ideal language for you is Ruby. Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.<strong>Have fun coding!</strong></p>
